# Generative Models
This repository is meant to be used as a playground to learn about generative networks. It is meant to be a long term project to learn many different kinds of techniques. 
# Folders
- /Face Generation: This folder contains different techniques for face generation. The files in the folder are:
    - celebAFaces.ipynb: Generative adversarial network with CNNs using TensorFlow
    - extractFaces.ipynb: Uses MTCNN to extract the faces from the celebrity dataset
    - loadCelebaModel.ipynb: Examples of the faces the models were able to generate. While the faces are clear, they are not that perfect because the training was done on a laptop
    - mnistCNNKerasGAN.ipynb: Basic generative model to solve the MNST problem using CNNs with Keras
    - mnistKerasGAN.ipynb: A basic generative model with very simple neural networks to solve the MNST with Keras
    - mnistTorchGAN.ipynb: Same as mnistKerasGAN.ipynb but with the use of Torch
    - utils.py: Helper code 
- /Style Transfer
